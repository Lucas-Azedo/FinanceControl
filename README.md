## Continuous Integration (CI)
This project uses GitHub Actions to automate testing and builds for both the backend and frontend every time code is pushed or a pull request is opened.

### How CI Works
Triggers: The CI workflow runs on every push and pull_request to any branch.

Backend Job:
- Spins up a MySQL 8.0 container for integration tests.
- Waits for the database to be ready before running tests.
- Builds and tests the backend using Maven with Java 21.
- Builds the backend Docker image (financecontrol-backend).

Frontend Job:
- Installs Node.js version 20.
- Installs frontend dependencies using npm ci.

## How to Run the Project
- Running with Docker (recommended for production and isolated development)
- This project uses Docker Compose to orchestrate 3 containers:


|Service|Role|
|-         |-                                 |
| db       | MySQL database container        |
| backend	 | Spring Boot backend application |
| frontend | Frontend application container  |


## Steps to run
1. Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.

2. Copy .env.example to .env and adjust variables as needed.

3. Run this command in the project root folder:

`docker-compose up --build`

4. Services will be available at:
- Backend: http://localhost:8080
- Frontend:  Frontend: http://localhost (accessible via default HTTP port 80)
- MySQL: accessible internally by the backend container
 ---
## Docker
### Container Architecture
- db: MySQL 8.0 container with persistent storage via Docker volume db_data.
- backend: Spring Boot application container, depends on the database.
- frontend: Frontend application container, depends on backend.

### Networking
All containers connect to a Docker network finance-net for secure, isolated communication.

### Communication flow
- Backend connects to DB via jdbc:mysql://${MYSQL_HOST}:${MYSQL_PORT}/${MYSQL_DATABASE} (defaults to jdbc:mysql://db:3306/financedb).
- Frontend calls backend APIs at http://backend:8080 within Docker network.
- Host machine exposes ports 3306, 8080, and 80 for external access.

### Useful commands

Start all containers:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Stop all containers:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

View backend logs:
```bash
docker logs -f finance-backend
```

Access backend container shell:
```bash
docker exec -it finance-backend /bin/sh`
```
