## Features

- User authentication with JWT
- Transaction management (add, edit, delete)
- Role-based access control
- Swagger API documentation
- Docker Compose setup for easy deployment

 ---
## Continuous Integration (CI)
This project uses **GitHub Actions** to automate testing and builds for both the backend and frontend on every `push` or `pull_request` to any branch.

### How It Works

#### Backend Job
- Starts a MySQL 8.0 container for integration tests.
- Waits until the database is available before proceeding.
- Sets up Java 21 and runs `mvn clean test`.
- Builds the backend Docker image (`financecontrol-backend`).

#### Frontend Job
- Sets up Node.js 20.
- Installs dependencies using `npm ci`.
- 
You can find the workflow file at .github/workflows/ci.yml

## How to Run the Project
- Running with Docker (recommended for production and isolated development)
- This project uses Docker Compose to orchestrate 3 containers:

|Service|Role|
|-         |-                                |
| db       | MySQL database container        |
| backend	 | Spring Boot backend application |
| frontend | Frontend application container  |

## Steps to run
1. Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.

2. Copy .env.example to .env and adjust variables as needed.

3. Run this command in the project root folder:

`docker-compose up --build`

4. Services will be available at:
- Backend: http://localhost:8080
- Frontend: http://localhost (accessible via default HTTP port 80)
- MySQL: accessible internally by the backend container (default port 3306)
- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
-

## Docker
### Container Architecture
- db: MySQL 8.0 container with persistent storage via Docker volume db_data.
- backend: Spring Boot application container, depends on the database.
- frontend: Frontend application container, depends on backend.

### Networking
All containers connect to a Docker network finance-net for secure, isolated communication.

### Communication flow
- Backend connects to DB via jdbc:mysql://${MYSQL_HOST}:${MYSQL_PORT}/${MYSQL_DATABASE} (defaults to jdbc:mysql://db:3306/financedb).
- Frontend calls backend APIs at http://backend:8080 within Docker network.
- Host machine exposes ports 3306, 8080, and 80 for external access.

### Useful commands

Start all containers:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Stop all containers:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

View backend logs:
```bash
docker logs -f finance-backend
```

Access backend container shell:
```bash
docker exec -it finance-backend /bin/sh
```
